# vba-challenge
module 2 hw submission

The attached file contains the vba code used to complete the homework.

Different resources were used to complete the assignment including class presentation material, class activities, chatgpt, stackoverflow, and a number of various sites consulted throughout the course of working on the homework.

Class material and activites were used to build the core of the code while ChatGPT, stackoverflow, and other sites were used in the troubleshooting process.

The code is located in my 'vba-challenge' repo on git hub.
